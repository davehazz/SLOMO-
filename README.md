# SLOMO-
This repository contains python code that allows users to apply a "slow motion" effect to their video.
The majority of the code was sourced from Geeks for Geeks.

Instructions:
1. Download the project
2. Add a video to your project folder
3. copy the path to the video in lines 5 and 6
4. once the video is in the project folder type the name of the video in lines 5 and 6
5. point 3 is optional once the video is in the project folder


Results:
The first output file(video) took 2 seconds to run where the second output video took 8 seconds to run.

Imagine in 1 second there are 6 frames per second(FPS). If we desire to apply the “Slow Motion” effect by a factor of 2, we need to decrease the amount of FPS by 2. This results in less frames in a second and the video appears to “slow-down”.

The video would appear still and slow-moving.

As oppose to increasing the FPS, the video would speed up and appear fast-moving. This can be seen in the image below:
